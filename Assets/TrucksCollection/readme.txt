------------------------------------------------------------------------
This collection contains 29 different types of trucks and trailers.

To use them, just drag the prefab into your scene
and use the "Truck-Color-Script" (attached to "body_main" of a single vehicle) 
to change to color of your car.
The script is used for the reason, to put one 
and the same car more than one time into your scene
and give them all different colors without adding
new materials.

The color will be set in the renderer by the script, 
so you will not see the result in the unity editor mode.

The Logos placed on each vehicle is done with seperate overlay objects
and a single 8 bit transparent texture for easy changing of the logo.

A special shader for the main surface and the windows
is also included.

All wheels are single objects parented to the cars to
make it easy to animate them or use them with physic-setups.

trailer feets and loadings ramps are also animateable.

Polycount for a single vehicle about 11.000 to 25.000.

Just open the example scene for a simple preview.
